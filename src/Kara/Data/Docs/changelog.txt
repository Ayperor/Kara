Changelog(v0.1-alpha):
    ~ Although she can only tell you the time... Kara is now in a functioning
      state! A module system has been finalized, allowing for her Abilities to
      be created with ease! This system took 4 days to make, Kara's time ability
      took 10 minutes. She mightn't have much now but the potential is there for
      anyone to create command's of their own.
